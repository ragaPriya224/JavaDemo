do the following tasks:
------------------------------------
go through array topic, string topic in w3schools from above links, and solve the w3exercises, related to that. 
-------------------------------
The following code should replace lol in the message with laugh out loud and print the new message.

        System.out.println(firstNameCaps);
    }
}
